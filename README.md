RobloxApi
=========

A C# Class Library for accessing ROBLOX Web APIs. (Excluding login APIs and API routes that require to be logged in as a ROBLOX user.)

Most of the methods in this Class Library uses [asynchronous Tasks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt674882.aspx).

## Unit Tests
The solution does contain a Unit Test Project (RobloxApi.Test)

To see the tests you can go to (Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer)

(They don't follow a strict guideline at the momement)

## Documentation
Currently some of the functions are documented using XML Documentation. The functions may be documented by using both XML Documentation and the GitHub Repository wiki.
